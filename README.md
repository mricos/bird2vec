# bird2vec
Bird2vec was a collaboration between conceptual artist Nire and Mike Ricos.

We achieved her vision of a research based art project
 using machine learning to  create novel bird sounds that are "sonically-consistent" 
 extinct bird recording while sonically evoking machine-like quality.
 
We used Chris Donahue's implementaiton of WavGan and retrained a GAN network with extinct bird
recordings, creating a sonic palette that allowed a mixture of latent space vectors that result
in convincing novel bird calls. The final product turned out quite interesting and evokes
the strains between man, animal and machine.
