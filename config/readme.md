## Configuration and Investigation

### This directory serves as a proof of concept/functionality for training [Chris Donahue's](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan) Tensorflow implementation of a WaveGAN on Google Colab.
The notebook **Wavegan_tf1_12p3_6.ipynb** outlines the necessary steps to train a WaveGAN using google colaboratory and store the results in a google drive.
Note: This implementation trains on the SC09 dataset (digits 0-9 spoken in English).

The notebook **Tensorboard-WG** is the notebook that allows the monitoring of the training through colab.
